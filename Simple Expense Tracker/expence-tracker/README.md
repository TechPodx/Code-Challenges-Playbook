# Simple Expence Tracker

The app allows you to set budgets for various categories, such as food and transportation, and track transactions in those categories. It then sums your spending in each category to calculate the amount of money that remains to be spent.

## How It Works

The Expense Tracker supports nine expense categories. Users can set their expected/budgeted expenses for each category. When they incur actual expenses in any category, they can update it in the "New Transaction" section. This action will reduce the remaining funds in the tracker and also display the new transaction under the "Transaction" section.
