# Simple Road Game (Practice to Redux)

This is a Text-based adventure game using reducers, state, and actions. The state will serve as a reflection of the game’s current status, encompassing elements such as the player’s inventory, distance covered, and time spent on the journey. Each occurrence within the game will be depicted as an action, allowing players to collect supplies, embark on travels, and occasionally, if they dare, encounter mishaps like overturning their wagon and losing their provisions.
